# Fallout-1-Rich-Presence

Shows Level, Character, and length of play session.

For all dependencies, ```pip install pypresence psutil pymem```

Run the command: ```Python fallout_rich_presence.py```, then start the game. 

This is my first attempt at this sort of thing, please hit me up on discord @ fn5.7 if there is any issues.
